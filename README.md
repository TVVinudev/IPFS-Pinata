# IPFS-Pinata 


IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized storage solution enabling secure file sharing. Pinata enhances IPFS by simplifying file pinning for persistence. Users can upload files to IPFS via Pinata's interface or API, ensuring data accessibility. Files can also be downloaded using their unique CID (Content Identifier), providing a robust, censorship-resistant platform for efficient file management.
